/*Friends Pairing Problem
There are n friends, we have to find all the pairings possible. Each person can be
paired with only one person or does not pair with anyone.
Idea: we have two options, iâ€™th friend does not get paired or we have n-1 options
to pair it with anyone.
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int friendPair(int n)
{
    if (n == 0 || n == 1 || n == 2)
        return n;

    return friendPair(n - 1) + friendPair(n - 2) * (n - 1);
}
int main()
{ 
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    cout << friendPair(n) << endl;
}
